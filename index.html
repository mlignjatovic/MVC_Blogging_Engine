			<p>“MVC  Blogging Engine” is the simple blogging  engine written with Fat-Free PHP Framework. I used “original” MVC pattern and that means that  I tried to use pattern on an image below.</p>

			<p>The Views are directly connected with Models and that communication is just for taking data <strong>FROM</strong> database. In this case, Views are not the templates, they  responsible for delegating right data to the right template and show the right template.</p>  
			<p>Controllers are responsible for manipulating <strong>ON</strong> database data (insert,edit,delete...).</p>
			<p>Models are places where actual logic behind Views and Controllers is taking place. Models are in direct connection with the database. </p>
			<h2>Little about functionality</h2>
			<p>I add tinymce for text processing.User can insert posts...</p>

			<p>Admin users can delete users and register new users.An editor can just see the list of users.</p>

			<p>Users can upload images and delete them.</p>
			<p><i>Image names are inserted in the database and actual files are uploaded in the uploads folder.</i></p>

			<p>If you decide to try blogging engine on your local computer(not for production usage),download source code from <a id="inline" href="https://github.com/mlignjatovic/MVC_Blogging_Engine">HERE</a>. In the config folder in config.ini file change database credentials to match your database. Then upload a SQL file to your database. If everything went ok, you can now login.
			User: admin , password: 123456 or User: editor, password: 123456.</p>
			<p>You will notice that there is not too much design. Templates are separated from logic so it is very easy to edit them. They are in Ui/ folder. Templates are made with Uikit so you have it at your disposal.</p>
